# 🏢 Building Handling System 

A lightweight web app for configuring buildings, floors, and rooms, then rendering a 3D campus-style view in the browser. Data is stored locally in the browser (localStorage) and the UI is optimized for quick setup and visualization.

## ✨ Features 
- 🏗️ Create multiple buildings (1 to 10) and assign custom names
- 🧱 Configure floors per building
- 🚪 Add rooms with capacity, schedule, teacher, subject, semester, and department
- 💾 Persist data in the browser with localStorage
- 🧭 Interactive 3D visualization using Three.js with orbit controls

## 🧰 Tech Stack 
- 🎨 Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap 5
- 🧊 3D: Three.js
- 🐍 Optional dev server: Flask (Python)

## 🚀 Quick Start 

### 🌐 Option A: Open as a static site 
1. Open `index.html` directly in a browser.

### 🧪 Option B: Run with Flask (recommended for local development) 
1. Create and activate a virtual environment.
2. Run the app:

```bash
python3 app.py
```

3. Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser.

## ✅ Usage 
1. Go to the `Data Input` view.
2. Set the number of buildings and click `Setup Buildings`.
3. Assign building names and floors.
4. Add rooms with schedule and metadata.
5. Switch to `View Buildings` to generate the 3D scene.
